-- #431: OWNER all-branch read access.
--
-- PROBLEM: the business rule gives OWNER view-only access to every branch, but
-- the role-derived GLOBAL VIEW_BRANCH_DATA leg only included SUPERUSER and
-- ACCOUNTANT. An OWNER assigned to one branch was therefore unable to read
-- reports and branch data outside that assignment.
--
-- CHANGE: preserve the existing capability union and add OWNER to the
-- role-derived GLOBAL VIEW_BRANCH_DATA whitelist. This grants only the read
-- window; branch-scoped write and day-state gates remain unchanged.
--
-- PRESERVED INVARIANTS:
--   - Business logic checks only this view; roles are never read directly.
--   - Explicit grants outrank derived rows (priority 5 remains unchanged).
--   - INACTIVE users and expired direct grants remain excluded.
--   - GLOBAL VIEW_BRANCH_DATA never satisfies BRANCH or BRANCH_DAY write gates.
--   - SUPERUSER, ACCOUNTANT, and all other role-derived capability behavior
--     remains unchanged.
